# EV

end-to-end example of a project that involves synthetic data generation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and forecasting/predictions. This project focuses on predicting electric vehicle (EV) sales using time-series analysis.

Project Overview:

Generate Synthetic Data: Create synthetic data for EV sales across several regions.
EDA: Visualize and analyze the synthetic data.
Forecasting: Build a model to predict future EV sales using a forecasting algorithm like ARIMA
